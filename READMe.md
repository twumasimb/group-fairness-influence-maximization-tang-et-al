In this repository, I will be implementing the code in the paper Group-fairness in Influence Maximization by Tang et al.

The code for this paper is already available at https://github.com/bwilder0/fair_influmax_code_release/.
However, I believe the best way to understand a paper is to implement it; that way you will have to explain it 
to the dumbest device (a computer) and if you can, then you do understand it.
